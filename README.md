# color_bet_game
a gamble game you bet on green and red to win more chips
# Game Logic
you can place bet on either "Red" or "Green".
you will spend 10x chips on your bet.
if you lose you will lost the chips you placed and if you won, you get doulbe amount of chips back.
your chips will be restocked once depleted. 

# Game Design
for this project I decide to try out the Hierarchical State Machine.
which contains 3 main game states:
<br>IDLE_STATE
<br>PLAY_STATE
<br>RESULT_STATE
